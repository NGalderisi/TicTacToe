# TicTacToe

Angular CLI Single Page Application


I wanted to learn how to build a SAP in Angular so this was me learning about how to do that.

I followed a tutorial for setting up the program.

You can see in the commit history where the tutorial ended and where my original works starts.

Also made use of issues tab to identify issues/bugs that needed fixed and features that I wanted to add.
